# About this flake

- Hosts defined in flake.nix; actual output entries are generated from hosts/default.nix, where home manager is also imported (options are defined later).
- Instead of users defined as a list, which I thought about, I just defined "username" as a string. If someone wants to share a computer with me, they can pry it from my cold dead hands.
  - Yes, "username" is visibly longer than "user". No, I don't care.
- Server runs caddy-tailscale + Nextcloud AIO (w/ docker) + immich.
